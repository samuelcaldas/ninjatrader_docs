| Alerts Overview Alerts allow you to define custom triggers based on various conditions in the [Market Analyzer](market_analyzer.md), [Hot List Analyzer](hot_list_analyzer.md), or [Charts](chart.md).  Unique and complex conditions can be built around existing market data components, indicators, or drawing tools.  The configuration of an Alert in NinjaTrader are completely achieved through a point and click interface, requiring no programming experience of any kind!   ›[Alerts Dialog](alerts_dialog.md)›[Configuring Alerts](configuring_alerts.md)›[Condition Builder](condition_builder.md) |

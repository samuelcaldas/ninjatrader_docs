| Playback Connection Overview The Playback Connection can be accessed by left mouse clicking on the Connection menu within the NinjaTrader Control Center and selecting the Playback menu item. You must close all other connections before connecting to Playback.   Playback   Before connecting, the Historical Data window will appear so that you can review the available data and download additional data before continuing.   Playback_Download   Playback utilizes the ability to download or record market data and replay it at another time. It is the same idea as recording your favorite TV show during the day and watching it at some other more convenient time. Unlike most products that only allow you to replay one market at a time, NinjaTrader provides synchronous replay of any and all recorded markets and delivers this market data to all NinjaTrader windows as if it was happening in real\-time. Therefore, you can have multiple SuperDOMs and charts replaying different markets all at the same time. You can trade in simulation against this data at varying levels of replay speed.   ›[Set Up](set_up12-1.md)›[Playback](playback-1.md)›[Data Files](data_files-1.md) |

| Added new TD Ameritrade API TD Ameritrade Feature \#14132   TD Ameritrade is requiring that we migrate to a new API, which has been implemented and is released in beta. The API has a lot of similarities between the old, with overall functionality expected to be the same. The new API does add option support for equities and utilizes a new connection type which is only available with supported operating systems, Windows 8 and newer. Please report any issues seen via [\[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#bbcbd7dacfddd4c9d6c8cecbcbd4c9cffbd5d2d5d1dacfc9dadfdec995d8d4d6). Note: At this time you may see duplicate executions if you disconnect and reconnect in the same session.   r22tdaapi |
| Added COT Indicator Indicator Feature \#13802   The COT indicator plots data from the Commitment of Traders reports. These are weekly reports (best viewed on a weekly chart) that come out each Friday showing Tuesday's open interest from market participants. These reports are available for many futures instruments. For more information, please see the [COT](cot.md) section of the help guide. Note: You must enable "Download COT data at startup" within Tools\> Options\> Market data for this indicator to plot.   r22cot |

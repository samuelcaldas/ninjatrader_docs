## Release Date
July 11, 2016
 
## Code Breaking Changes
Compile Errors
- The NinjaScript Strategy "AccountSize" concept was removed due to limited functionality.  This change would also impact strategies which were coded to use [SetOrderQuantity.ByAccountSize](setorderquantity-1.md).  Please use your own variables to set quantities by account size. Tip:  NinjaTrader 8 can read real\-world account values for live trading purposes through the Account class, e.g., Account.Get(AccountItem.CashValue, Currency.UsDollar) provides a method for returning a double value representing the current cash value of the account.

 
Implementation changes
- The concept used to force plot series objects through ForcePlotsMaximumBarsLookBackInfinite was disabled and tagged as obsolete.  You should set any indicator/strategy plots to [MaximumBarsLookBack.Infinite](maximumbarslookback-1.md) during its construction.

- It is recommended that any strategies generated with the 'Strategy Builder' tool via Control Center \> New \> Strategy Builder be removed and recreated after installing B12\. If you had invested significant effort in a Strategy Builder generated strategy in B11 which you would like to continue to use, please contact us [\[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#097965687d6f667b647a7c7979667b7d4967606763687d7b686d6c7b276a6664)

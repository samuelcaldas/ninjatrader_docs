The Optimizing Strategies video covers the aspects of optimizations which differ from standard backtests.      Understanding Walk-Forward Optimization Walk-Forward Optimization combines the features of optimizations and standard backtests. This Backtest Type performs an optimization over a pre-defined date range, then applies the optimal parameter combinations to a standard backtest over another pre-defined date range.      Understanding Multi-Objective Optimization Multi-Objective Optimization uses Pareto Analysis to find a set of possible input-value combinations which score higher or lower on individual metrics (of which there can be many), but for which there are no obviously superior alternatives on all metrics tested. This video introduces the goals of Multi-Objective Optimization and explains the concept of the Pareto Frontier.      Understanding the Genetic Algorithm The Genetic Algorithm is an optional optimization engine which leverages evolutionary theory to find optimal combinations of strategy input parameters through multi-generational crossover and mutation, focusing on the fittest individuals in each generation. |

## Release Date


March 21, 2016


 


This is a general maintenance release which includes various bug fixes due to feedback received during beta. Please note that as this is a maintenance release, there are still outstanding bugs which were reported in previous beta versions and this release does not guarantee all previously reported bugs have been resolved.  If you cannot find the status of a bug you previously reported using the table below, please feel free to contact our support team with the tracking ID which was provided at the time the bug was reported (e.g., NTEIGHT\-1234\)


 


## Code Breaking Changes


There are no code\-breaking changes which would impact the compilation of documented and supported NinjaScript code; your custom NinjaScript scripts should upgrade without errors from B9 to B10\.  If you run into errors, please contact the original author, or reach out for assistance on the [support forum](http://www.ninjatrader.com/support/forum/index.php).


 


Due to user feedback, we have changed the default Strategy behavior during optimizations which sometimes caused a strategy to return inconsistent results.  To help reduce variance in each optimization run, we have changed the IsInstantiatedOnEachOptimizationIteration property to be to true by default.  Please note, unless you have specifically coded your strategies to take advantage of re\-using strategy data, Strategy Optimizations could potentially run slower.  To take advantage of performance benefits during Strategy Optimization, please see our examples [IsInstantiatedOnEachOptimizationIteration](isinstantiatedoneachoptimizationiteration-1.md) Help Guide entry.

## Release Date
February 16, 2016
 
This is a general maintenance release which includes various bug fixes due to feedback received during beta. Please note that as this is a maintenance release, there are still outstanding bugs which were reported in previous beta versions and this release does not guarantee all previously reported bugs have been resolved.  If you cannot find the status of a bug you previously reported using the table below, please feel free to contact our support team with the tracking ID which was provided at the time the bug was reported (e.g., NTEIGHT-1234)
 
| Attention Trading Technologies Users:  Due to limited use and low user feedback during the beta period, we have removed the Trading Technologies adapter from NinjaTrader 8.  Users can still connect to their brokerage by using NinjaTrader 7. |
| --- |

| Attention FXCM Users:  As a result of Issue #9270, related to FXCM CFD's and commissions, you may need to manually delete your database file if you were using an FXCM CFD account with a Commission Template configured, otherwise errors may be generated.  Please contact [[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#f2829e9386949d809f818782829d8086b29c9b9c9893868093969780dc919d9f) should you receive errors on start-up after updating. |

## Code Breaking Changes
 
| Tip:  We have expanded information in our NinjaScript Educational Resources section regrading best practices for new [muti-threading considerations](multi-threading-1.md) in NinjaTrader 8 |
| --- |
## 
- [SetTrailStop()](settrailstop-1.md), [SetStopLoss()](setstoploss-1.md), [SetProfitTarget()](setprofittarget-1.md) - removed redundant double type "currency" overloaded.  Set CalculationMode enum instead e.g., SetTrailStop(CalculationMode.Price, Low[0])

- [DrawingTools.ChartAnchor](chartanchor-1.md)  - removed ChartAnchor constructor with int type "barsAgo" parameter as it was problematic.  Use DateTime time values to build your drawing tools chart anchor objects instead.

- Bars.SessionIterator object was removed due to complications with some bar types.  You can use your own custom [SessionIterator](sessioniterator-1.md) built from a Bars object instead.  

a.For Indicators, please see the system Custom\\Indicators @CurrentDayOHL.cs, @Pivots.cs, PriorDayOHLC.cs, or the examples in the [SessionIterator](sessioniterator-1.md) Help guide section for examples of correct indicator usage.  

b.For custom Bar Types, please see the [BarsType.SessionIterator](barstype_sessioniterator-1.md) Help Guide page, or any of the system Custom\\BarTypes installed by default.

- There were several changes to PerformanceMetrics.  These changes will NOT affect any strategy/system performance calculations, but if you develop own custom [PerformanceMetric](performancemetrics-1.md) please be aware of the changes listed below.  You may also review the PerformanceMetric @SampleCumProfit.cs for an example of correct usage.

a.PerformanceMetric.ValueArrayLength was removed as it is no longer need

b.Added new [OnCopyTo()](oncopyto-1.md) method

c.[OnMergePerformanceMetric()](onmergeperformancemetric-1.md) has a reversed the target/source logic to be in sync with new OnCopyTo() method

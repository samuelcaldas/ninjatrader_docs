| Level II Window Overview You can access the Level II window from within the NinjaTrader Control Center window by left mouse clicking on the menu New, and then selecting the menu item Level II.   The Level II window displays bid and ask data color coded by price. It is used to gauge strength and depth on either side of the market. Each price row in the Details section shows a Market Maker or ECN for that price level. For non\-Nasdaq stocks, market depth is displayed for the regional exchange the market is traded.   › [Using the Level II Window](levelii_usingtheleveliiwindow.md)› [Level II Properties](levelii_properties.md)› [Window Linking](levelii_windowlinking.md) |

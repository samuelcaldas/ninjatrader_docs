| Instruments Window Overview The Instruments window can be accessed by left mouse clicking on the Tools menu within the NinjaTrader Control Center and selecting the menu item Instruments. NinjaTrader supports multiple connectivity providers and therefore manages a single instrument instance (master instrument) which maintains the parameters required to establish market data and order permissions through the various connectivity sources. The Instruments window manages the instrument data and can add or remove instruments from the database. NinjaTrader maintains a predefined database of commonly traded instruments on our server and your local database is updated automatically on NinjaTrader application startup.   ›[Searching for Instruments](searching_for_instruments.md)›[Managing Instruments](manage_database.md)›[Editing Instruments](editing_instruments.md)›[Rolling Over Futures Contracts](rolling_over_a_futures_contrac.md)›[Adding Splits and Dividends](adding_splits_and_dividends.md)›[TradeStation Symbol Mapping](tradestation_symbol_mapping.md)›[Importing a List of Stock Symbols](importing_a_list_of_stock_symb.md) |

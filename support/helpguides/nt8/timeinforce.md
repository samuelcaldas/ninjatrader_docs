## Definition


Sets the time in force property for all orders generated by a strategy. The selected TIF parameter is sent to your broker on order submission and will instruct how long you would like the order to be active before it is cancelled. 


 




| Note:  This property is dependent on what time in force your broker may or may not support.  If a brokerage / exchange combination is not compatible with a particular time in force, the order will be rejected by the broker. NinjaTrader does not have a method to prevent an unsupported TIF to be sent to a particular exchange.  For questions about what TIF may be supported, please contact your broker directly. |

## Property Value


An enum value that determines the time in force.  Default value is set to TimeInForce.Gtc.  Possible values are:




| TimeInForce.Day | Orders will be canceled by the broker at the end of the trading session |
| --- | --- |
| TimeInForce.Gtc | Order will remain working until the order is explicitly cancelled. |
| TimeInForce.Gtd | Order will remain working until the specified date |

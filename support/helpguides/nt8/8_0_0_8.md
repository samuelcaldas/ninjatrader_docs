## Release Date
January 8, 2016
 
This is a general maintenance release which includes various bug fixes and minor feature enhancements due to feedback received during beta. Please note that as this is a maintenance release, there are still outstanding bugs which were reported in previous beta versions and this release does not guarantee all previously reported bugs have been resolved.  If you cannot find the status of a bug you previously reported using the table below, please feel free to contact our support team with the tracking ID which was provided at the time the bug was reported (e.g., NTEIGHT\-1234\)
 
| Attention Interactive Brokers Users: This release is up\-to\-date with the most recent stable Interactive Broker's software version 954 for both TWS and Gateway.  These versions included changes to the way the IB interfaces are executed and thus the way NinjaTrader uses the "Auto login" feature.  As a result, you MUST update in order for NinjaTrader to automatically start and connect to your account; otherwise you will need to manually start your TWS or Gateway interfaces before attempting to connect from NinjaTrader.  Please see our Connection Guide [here](http://www.ninjatrader.com/ConnectionGuides/Interactive-Brokers-Connection-Guide). |

## Code Breaking Changes
The following NinjaScript changes have taken effect between B7 and B8:
 
PriceLevel.GetPrice():  Removed redundant [chartScale overload](pricelevels-1.md)
 
NS Editor Folders:
There were changes to the way folders are used in NS editor due to client feedback per issue \# 9164\. Users who had been using folders will need to restructure their NinjaScript files manually.  For example:
 
- With NinjaTrader 8 shut down, navigate to bin\\Custom\\Indicators and remove the namespaces from any applicable files. (e.g., rename SpecialFolder.TheIndicatorName.cs \-\> TheIndicatorName.cs)

- Open NinjaTrader 8 and the NinjaScript Editor

- Right\-click on the Indicators folder and add a new folder with the old namespace (e.g., SpecialFolder)

- Drag the relevant files for that namespace into the new folder to create the proper folder/file structure

 
Repeat these steps for any other NinjaScript types (Strategies, DrawingTools, etc) which may had been using the old folder structure.  Doing so will now allow the NS Editor folders to be replicated on the physical file system.
 
You can read more about the NinjaScript Folders in the "Managing scripts and folders" section of the [NinjaScript Explorer](ns_explorer-1.md) help guide article.

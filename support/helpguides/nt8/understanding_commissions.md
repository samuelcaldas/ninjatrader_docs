| Commissions Overview The Commissions window allows you to define global and per instrument commission rates to be used on local Simulation or Live account. Commissions applied are visible inside the Trade Performance window. Setting up commissions in a local simulation account will help you make sure that you factor in the cost of trading into your Trade Performance analysis and can also be used in live accounts so that you can keep track of your actual PnL less commissions, which typically is not factored into PnL values provided by brokers.   ›[Working with Commission Templates](adding_per_instrument_commissi_2.md)›[Applying Commission Templates](adding_per_instrument_commissi_3.md) |

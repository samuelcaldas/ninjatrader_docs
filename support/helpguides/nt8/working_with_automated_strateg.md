| Strategy Persistence Automated strategies always persist on a chart whenever it is open, even if Enabled is set to false inside the chart's Strategies window. For example, if you shut down NinjaTrader with an enabled strategy in a chart, then reopen NinjaTrader, the strategy will still be applied to the chart with the property Enabled being set to false. This allows you to enable the strategy without having to reconfigure the parameters. However, when the chart containing the automated strategy is closed, the strategy will not persist; it will be disabled and removed.   Reloading NinjaScript An automated strategy can be reloaded by right mouse clicking in the chart and selecting the menu item Reload NinjaScript. Reloading an automated strategy will remove the existing instance of the strategy and add a new one in the chart.   ReloadNinjaScript |

| Executions Automated strategy trade executions will be displayed in the chart, depending on the Plot Executions parameter of the Data Series. The chart below shows several executions from orders placed by an automated strategy, and each execution is labeled with an appropriate name. Only executions pertaining to the strategy on the chart will be visible when the strategy is enabled. Any manual executions, or executions from strategies not applied to the chart, will NOT be shown. Execution markers are configured for each Data Series by selecting the Plot Executions parameter from the [Data Series window](working_with_price_data.md).   StrategyExecutions     | Note: You can view historical trades when a strategy is applied to a chart because the [IncludeTradeHistoryInBacktest](includetradehistoryinbacktest.md) property is set to true by default when a strategy is applied to a chart. You can set this property to false in your code for leaner memory management, at the cost of not being able to access this information. For more information, see the [Working with Historical Trade Data](strategyanalyzer_properties_2.md) page. | | --- | |

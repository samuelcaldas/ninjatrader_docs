Chart Objects represent various Data Series, Indicators, or Drawing Tools which have been configured on the chart.  There are several ways to interact with these chart objects in order to control their behavior and appearance.

| Drag and Drop A Data Series or Indicator can be dragged and dropped to various areas of the chart to quickly change which panel it displays.    Left mouse click on a chart object within a chart and drag and drop to any of the following areas of the chart:   1\.Upper limit \- Creates a new panel at the top of the chart2\.In between panels \-  Creates a new panel in between two existing panels3\.Lower limit \- Creates a new panel at the bottom of the chart4\.Center area of a panel \- Relocates the selected chart object to this panel and automatically determines the most suitable scale justification5\.Left or right area of a panel \- Relocates the selected chart object to this panel (unless already in the selected panel) and changes the scale justification to the selected side of the panel.  When you drag a selected object to a valid region on the chart, a blue band will appear acknowledging you that by dropping the object at this particular location, a new panel will be created. |

![tog_minus](tog_minus-1.gif)        [How to change the z\-order (paint order) of a chart object](javascript:HMToggle('toggle','HowToChangeTheZorderpaintOrderOfAChartObject','HowToChangeTheZorderpaintOrderOfAChartObject_ICON'))
| Z\-Order Objects within a panel can be adjusted by paint order to appear behind or in front of another chart object.   You can change the z\-order (paint order) of all chart objects within each individual panel. Each chart object is assigned a level value which informs you where in the paint order the particular object resides. As a rule of thumb, there are as many levels on a panel as there are chart objects on it. For example, if you had a Data Series and a simple moving average indicator on a panel, there would be two painting levels. Level 1 is the top most level which means that any chart object on Level 1 would be painted above all others. Continuing our example, if the Data Series was on Level 1 of 2 and the simple moving average was on Level 2 of 2, that would mean the Data Series would be painted on top of the Data Series.   The image below depicts a "Rectangle" drawing object set at z\-order Level 3 of 3, which is behind both the Stochastics indicator (Level 2 of 3\) and the ES 12\-09 Data Series (Level 1 of 3\).   To adjust the z\-order:   1\.Select the chart object by left mouse clicking on it2\.Hold down the "Shift" key on your keyboard and roll the mouse scroll wheel to change the z\-order of the object. The current position out of the total number of levels in the z\-scale will be displayed.    | Note: Draw objects originating from a NinjaScript indicator or strategy will all generally share the same z\-order as the script. To have the objects on a separate z\-order would have to be set programmatically. | | --- | |

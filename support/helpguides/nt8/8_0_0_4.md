- Strategy IsExitOnCloseStrategy \- renamed to [IsExitOnSessionCloseStrategy](isexitonsessionclosestrategy-1.md)

- Strategy ExitOnCloseSeconds \- renamed to [ExitOnSessionCloseSeconds](exitonsessioncloseseconds-1.md) 

- Order signal name "Exit on close" \- string renamed to "Exit on session close"

- BarsType AddDataPoint() \- renamed to [AddBar()](addbar-1.md) (for consistency)

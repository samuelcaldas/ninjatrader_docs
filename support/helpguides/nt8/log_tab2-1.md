| Log Display Log events are categorized and color coded based on four distinct alert levels; Information, Warning, Error and Alert.   ControlCenter_LogGrid   Each log event is displayed by date, category and message. In some cases, the length of the message may be larger than the width of the "Message" column. In this situation, you can hover your mouse above the message in order to have it display in a pop-up type window.   Right Click Menu Right mouse clicking within the log display section opens the following menu:   ControlCenter_Log_ContextMenu     | Always On Top | Sets if the window will be always on top of other windows | | --- | --- | | Show Tabs | Sets if the window should allow for tabs | | Export | Exports the grid contents to "CSV" or "Excel" file format | | Find... | Search for a term in the grid | | Print | Select to print either the window or the log grid area. | | Share | Select to share via your share connections. | | Properties... | Configure the positions grid properties | |

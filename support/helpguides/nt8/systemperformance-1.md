## Definition
The SystemPerformance object holds all trades and trade performance data generated by a strategy.
 
| Notes: - A NinjaScript strategy can generate both synthetic trades (historical backtest trades) and real-time trades executed on a real-time data stream. If you wish to access only real-time trades, access the "RealTimeTrades" collection - The first trade of the "RealTimeTrades" collection will contain a synthetic entry execution if the strategy was NOT flat at the time you start the strategy. - These properties require that [IncludeTradeHistoryInBacktest](includetradehistoryinbacktest-1.md) be set to true. |

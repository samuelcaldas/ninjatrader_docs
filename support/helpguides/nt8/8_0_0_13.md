## Release Date
August 31st, 2016
 
This release marks our first NinjaTrader 8 Release Candidate.  Since the very first NinjaTrader 8 beta version, we have resolved over 4500 bugs thanks to the ongoing efforts of our beta community, and we feel confident we are closer than ever to a production NinjaTrader 8 release.  If you have installed a NinjaTrader 8 beta version and reported feedback to our support team \- thank you!
 
As this is a release candidate, NinjaTrader 8\.0\.0\.13 is still considered a beta product and we will continue to focus on product quality.  Please continue to report any issues you may encounter to our support staff.   We will monitor the status of this release to determine when we will announce and launch the production release of NinjaTrader 8\.
 
| Attention MB Trading Users:  Due to limited use and low user feedback during the beta period, we have removed the MB Trading adapter from NinjaTrader 8\.  You may continue to use NinjaTrader 7\. |

## Code Breaking Changes
Compile Errors
- The [Stroke](stroke_class-1.md) object .Dispose() method was removed due to technical redundancy.  To remove memory resources from any stroke objects, simply set the stroke to null.

- Removed property Bars.IsTimebased \-\> please use [Bars.BarsType.IsTimeBased](barstype_istimebased-1.md) instead

- Account.Accounts was renamed to [Account.All](all-1.md)

 
Implementation changes
- The common signature "isInclude60" used in various [SessionIterator](sessioniterator-1.md) methods was renamed to "includesEndTimeStamp" to be more specific

- Category display order values of standard NinjaTrader Property Grid Categories were updated to be more consistent application wide.  These changes could impact any customization you were doing using the [CategoryOrderAttribute](categoryorderattribute-1.md), however, the documentation was also updated to reflect the implementation more accurately and will allow you to use this attribute reliably.

- To assist with transitioning historical order objects to real\-time order references, please use the new [GetRealtimeOrder()](getrealtimeorder-1.md) method.

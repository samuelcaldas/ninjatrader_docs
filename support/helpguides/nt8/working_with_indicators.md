NinjaTrader comes with over 100 pre-built technical indicators, which can be added, removed and edited via the Indicators window. Indicators can be applied to [charts](charts.md), the [SuperDOM](superdom.md), or [Market Analyzer](working_with_columns.md) columns, and custom technical indicators can be created via the [NinjaScript Editor](editor.md).

| Editing an Indicator You can customize any indicator from the Indicators window.   1.Open the Indicators window (see the "Understanding the Indicators window" section above)2.Highlight the indicator you would like to edit from the list of applied indicators3.Once highlighted, this indicator's parameters will be available to edit in the "Properties" section.   Chart Indicator Parameters The following parameters are common to all indicators applied on a chart:   Indicators2     | Input Series | Please see the "Indicator Input Series" section on this page for further information. | | --- | --- | | Calculate | Sets the frequency at which the indicator performs its calculations. See the note below for information on each possible setting for this property | | Label | The label displayed on the chart. Leaving the field blank will remove the label from being displayed on the chart. Enclosing a label in quotations ("MyEMA" for example) will display the text within the quotations and exclude the system added trailing series information. | | Maximum Bars Look Back | Determines the maximum number of bars the indicator can look back to perform calculations on historical data. This is set to 256 by default (the most memory-friendly setting), but it can be changed to "infinite" to allow for a greater look back period. | | Auto Scale | When enabled, the indicator will be included in the chart panel's vertical automatic scaling | | Displacement | Sets the number of bars by which to displace the indicator plots | | Display in Data Box | Enables or disables the inclusion of the indicator's plot values in the Data Box | | Panel | Sets the panel in which the indicator is plotted. If you select "Same as input series," the indicator will be linked to the Input Series and automatically move if the Input Series is modified to a different panel. | | Price marker(s) | When enabled, the indicator value is plotted in the axis selected under the "Scale Justification" property. | | Scale justification | Sets the scale on which the indicator will be plotted. Possible values are "Right," "Left," and "Overlay" | | Visible | Enables or disables visibility and function of the indicator on the chart | | Plots | Sets a variety of parameters, such as color, for the plots drawn by the indicator |        | Note: The "Calculate" property offers three possible settings to control how often an indicator performs its calculations: - On Bar Close - Run calculations once on the close of each bar of the Input Series- On Each Tick - Run calculations on each incoming tick of price data (CPU intensive)- On Price Change - Runs calculations on each change in price | | --- |      Saving an Indicator's Parameters You can optionally save your customized indicator's parameters as templates. Saving it as Default will recall your customized settings the next time you add that specific indicator to a chart.   Please see the [Saving Chart Defaults and Templates](saving_chart_defaults_and_templates.md) page for more information.   Indicator Input Series The indicator Input Series dialogue allows you to select the Input Series for your indicator's calculations. To access this window, left mouse click within the "Input Series" field. You can then select the Close, High, Low, Median, Open, Typical, or Weighted price of any Data Series applied to the chart. Alternatively, you can choose another indicator as the input series. When you select another indicator as the input series, The "Properties" section of the Input Series dialogue will display properties related to the indicator being used as the Input Series, allowing you to configure it to your desired settings. This allows you to nest multiple indicators. Once you have selected the Input Series of your choice, left mouse click the OK button to exit the Input Series window.   Indicators4   In the image above, we can select one of the Data Series applied to the chart, or another indicator, for use as an indicator's Input Series.     | Note: To take advantage of this feature NinjaScript indicators will need to implement the [Input](input.md) ISeries as their main data input. | | --- | |

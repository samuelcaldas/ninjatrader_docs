NinjaTrader provides a free vendor license management service for user authentication to qualified 3rd party developers. 
 
The service includes the following features:
 
- One method call within your NinjaScript indicator or strategy's constructor will enable the authentication process 

- A NinjaScript AddOn dedicated to license management (Manage license, provide free trials)

- Licenses are exclusively tied to a combination of user-defined prefix + PC machine ID value, ensuring that licenses cannot be shared 

- Manage all of your individual products, or group products together for licensing

- Licenses expire based on time/date

- Create free trial periods

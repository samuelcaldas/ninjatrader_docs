October 25, 2023

| Features |
| --- |
| SuperDOM Pulling/Stacking column Feature \#2873   8120PullingStacking   The Pulling/Stacking column is a customizable display that indicates the changes in the market depth based on user settings or if a reset notification is received. For example, in the screenshot above the sell depth at 4520\.75 was initially at 91, but dropped to 84 resulting in a display of \-7\. Within the columns settings you can change the reset to occur on bid/ask change or when no longer receiving depth data at that level. Additionally, you can adjust reset tolerance and color settings. |
| SuperDOM Recent column Feature \#2874   8120Recent   The Recent column is a customizable display that indicates the recent volume that occurred at the bid or ask prices. For example, in the above screenshot we can see a volume of 1 occurred at the bid price and a volume of 4 occurred at the ask. Within the column's settings you can change the reset to occur when the bid/ask change or when the price returns. Additionally, you can adjust the reset tollerance and color settings. |
| Selected indicators label displays in bold/italic Feature \#2894   8120BoldIndicator   Often times multiple indicators can be loaded on a chart and it can be difficult to know what plot is for what indicator and settings.

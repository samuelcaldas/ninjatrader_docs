The Alerts Dialog will list any alerts that are currently configured for the window the dialog was launched from as well as allow you to configure any running alerts.  Alerts run on a per tab basis for each window.  This means if you have two charts open in your workspace, the alerts dialog will only list alerts running from that specific tab.

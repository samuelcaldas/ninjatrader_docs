NinjaTrader's Strategy Builder includes access to many methods and properties, including the IsRising() and IsFalling() methods. It is possible to check if an indicator (or any Series<t>) is rising or falling using these methods. You can also use High values, Low values, or any other Series<t> with IsRising() or IsFalling() to qualitatively determine the direction of the DataSeries. This simple sample demonstrates IsRising() and IsFalling() in the Strategy Builder.

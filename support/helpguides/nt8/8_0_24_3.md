| Features |
| --- |
| Enhancements to take advantage of additional levels of depth SuperDOM, Depth Chart, Order Flow + Feature #14781   r24depth   Order Flow Market Depth Map had a setting added called Number of levels to track, which can be configured to track more than the default 10 levels of depth. Depth Chart now is enabled for futures and cryptocurrency instruments. SuperDOM columns performance has been enhanced to handle more levels of depth. Multiple data providers offer more than 10 levels of depth. NinjaTrader Continuum & CQG have begun adding more levels of depth on popular instruments. |
| Multiple workspaces will open at startup only when opted in to do so Workspaces Feature #14761   r24workspaces   One of the main causes of increased resources being used is multiple workspaces running at the same time and most people don't even realize that is occurring. To help boost performance, NinjaTrader now will only open multiple workspaces at start up for users who opt into doing so. No action is needed to only open 1 workspace at start up. To opt in for multiple workspaces, go to the Control Center> General and enable Reopen all previously open workspaces at startup. |
| Commissions template values can now be applied to Realized PnL Commissions Feature #14726   r24realized   Viewing realized PnL when flat from your order entry windows can now be shown in Gross realized PnL or Total PnL. Within order entry windows, the property previously named Show gross realized PnL when flat has been renamed to Show realized PnL when flat. By default it will continue to show Gross realized PnL. To show Total PnL, within the Control Center go to Tools> Trading and enable Use total PnL for Show realized PnL when flat. |

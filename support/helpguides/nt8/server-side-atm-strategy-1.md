Majority of NinjaTrader's order entry interfaces house the same control for defining an ATM Strategy.

| The Strategy Control List The drop down list shown in the image below is very important to understand as it defines how your orders will be handled once submitted. There are two main categories of options that will be displayed in this drop-down list; None, Custom or strategy template names. Strategy templates are specific to your account and instrument.   ServerSideATM_1   None When this option is selected, any orders placed in the entry window will not be applied to an active ATM Strategy nor will it initiate a new ATM strategy.   Custom or ATM Strategy Template Names When an ATM Strategy template name is selected, all of the parameters will update to reflect your pre-defined ATM Strategy, or when Custom is selected, you have the ability to define a new ATM Strategy on the fly. Once an order is submitted, the ATM Strategy parameters specified will be initiated when the order is partially or completely filled.     | Note: If a server side ATM template was created on Web, it may include features not available on Desktop. The template will still submit and function as it was saved. | | --- | |

| ATM Strategy Parameters Select Custom to define a new ATM Strategy or select the saved ATM Strategy template and select "edit" in the ATM Strategy combo box as seen below.   ServerSideATM_2   In the image below there are parameters that define the ATM Strategy. This strategy is a single quantity strategy that will automatically place its target at 10 ticks above the average entry price and stop loss 10 ticks below.   ServerSideATM_3   Selecting the "add" will allow you to configure additional Targets for your ATM Strategy.  You can add as many targets as you desire.  Selecting "remove" will reduce the number of configured Targets that are configured.   ServerSideATM_4       | Order quantity | Replicated from the order entry display and sets the initial quantity used for the entry order. | | --- | --- | | TIF (Time In Force) | Replicated from the order entry display and sets the TIF used for entry, profit target, and stop loss orders. | | Parameter type | Sets the type of parameter to display the ATM values in. All Parameter types function the same     | Ticks | Ticks away from the average entry. | | --- | --- | | Delta Price | Price away from the average entry, based on the displayed price of the instrument. AKA Points away from the average entry. | | $ Value | Cash value away from the average entry, based on to Tick value of the instrument. |      Example: Long 1 contract on the ES at 4,000.00. If you wanted your Profit target to be at 4,001.00 you would use: Ticks - 4, Delta Price 1.00, or $ Value - 50.00 | | Quantity | Sets the quantity for the Stop Loss and Profit Target orders for this target | | Stop Loss | Sets the value that determines the Stop Loss price. If the value is set to 4 (ticks) and your average entry for the initiating order is 1000 and you are long, your Stop Loss would be submitted at AvgEntry - Stop Loss = 1000 - 4 ticks = stop price of 999. This assumes each tick is valued at 0.25. | | Profit | Sets the value that determines the Profit target price. If the value is set to 4 (ticks) and your average entry for initiating the order is 1000 and you are long, your Profit target would be submitted at AvgEntry + Profit target = 1000 + 4 ticks = 1001 Profit target. This assumes that each tick is valued at 0.25. | | Stop Strategy | Sets the Stop Strategy |      For further reference, please look at the [Server Side Strategy Examples](tutorial-server-side-atm-examp.md) located within the "[Server Side ATM Strategy](server-side-atm-strategy-1.md)" page. |

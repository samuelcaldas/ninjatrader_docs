NinjaTrader is a true mixed live/simulation platform. You can have multiple entry windows open and using the account drop down menu, simultaneously route orders to your live broker in one window while routing orders to the simulator in another. This provides you the flexibility to trade live while testing different methods or ideas in simulation.

## What is the Sim101 account?


The Sim101 account is a default account that represents your own simulated account through which you place simulated trades. The Sim101 account behaves identical to a live account in that it has a cash balance, profit and loss and other financial parameters. For example, when placing orders to the simulator, the Sim101 account is checked to ensure that you are not exceeding your buying power.

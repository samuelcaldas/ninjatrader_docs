## Release Date


May 12, 2016


 


## Code Breaking Changes


Compile Errors


•[Draw.RegionHighlightY()](draw_regionhighlighty-1.md), [Draw.ArrowLine()](draw_arrowline-1.md) – Added missing "isAutoScale" bool to some signatures

 


Implementation changes


•In some scenarios, the OnRender() method no longer guarantees the bars indexer to be up to date before it is called. Due to the multi\-threaded nature of NinjaTrader, attempting to access a series barsAgo value could return seemingly unexpected results (E.g., Close\[0], SMA(20\)\[0], etc).  This change does NOT impact data driven events, such as OnBarUpdate(), OnMarketData(), OnOrderUpdate(), etc.  For all OnRender() purposes, you should consider using an absolute index lockup through [Bars.GetClose(barIndex)](getclose-1.md), or [\<series\>.GetValueAt(barIndex)](getvalueat-1.md) which are generally more reliable in non\-data driven events.  Please also see the new [IsValidDataPointAt()](isvaliddatapointat-1.md) which was added to help with absolute index look up.

 


•Type Casting [DrawObjects](drawingtools_drawobjects-1.md) can fail from a compiled assembly.  In situations where you need to cast a draw object in an assembly, it is recommended you use the dynamic type and compare the object type by its string.  This is not required for non\-protected scripts.  Please see the help guide article on [Considerations For Compiled Assemblies](considerations_for_compiled_assemblies-1.md) for more details and examples.

You can select what connections you want to connect to or disconnect to. When Multi\-provider is enabled, you will be able to configure any additional connection or connect to ones already configured. See the [Enabling/Disabling Muli\-provider Mode](enabling_disabling-multi-provi.md) section of the Help Guide. A connection is where you set up your user name, password and any relevant information that allows you to establish a connection to your broker and/or data feed service.   ControlCenter_ConnectionsMain |

| Features |
| --- |
| .NET 4\.8 Upgrade General Feature \#14630   NinjaTrader 8 is built utilizing Microsoft's .NET framework. Microsoft recommends upgrading to .NET Framework 4\.8 to receive the highest level of performance, reliability, security, and long\-term support from Microsoft. This update is expected to be entirely transparent as most users already have .NET framework 4\.8 automatically installed via windows update.  When installing NinjaTrader, it will prompt you if you need to install .NET 4\.8, and if required, you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer). Additionally, as a result of this update, Windows 8\.1 becomes the minimum supported operating system. |
| New default playback mode 'Playback from selected'  Playback Feature \#14287   This new mode will load historical data up to the selected time frame and start playback from there. This will increase the speed of changing times for users who don't have scripts or strategies that need to process each data event as it comes in.   r23playbackmode |
| Auto rollover notification Instruments, DataBase Feature \#14599   A pop up will now appear when starting NinjaTrader or opening a workspace while there is an instrument in the instrument list or workspace that has rolled over. This will help ensure that the latest contracts are loaded with ease.   r23rollover |
| COT instrument mapping added to Instrument editor Indicator, Instruments Feature \#14552   Mapping for COT data has been added to the Instrument editor to allow adding COT mapping for newly created instruments or adding to existing ones. For some instruments that do not have COT data you could map to related instruments if desired. For example, you could map COT data from a mini contract to a micro.   r23cotmapping |
| Added extended backwards option for Andrew's Pitchfork DrawingTool Feature \#14553   The extend lines back property adds additional functionality to Andrew's Pitchfork for your technical analysis needs.   r23andrewspitchfork |
| Interactive Broker auto reconnects after daily restart Interactive Brokers Feature \#14510   Both Traders Workstation and Gateway connections will now auto reconnect after their daily restart. |

# IsFillLimitOnTouch

## Definition

Determines if the strategy will use a more liberal fill algorithm for back-testing purposes only.  The default behavior of the strategy's fill algorithm is to fill a limit order once price has penetrated the limit price.  However this behavior can be changed by setting IsFillLimitOnTouch to true, in which case the strategy's fill algorithm will consider a limit order filled once price has reached the limit price, but does not necessarily need to trade through the limit price

## Property Value

This property returns true if the strategy will fill limit orders when touched; otherwise, false. Default is set to false.

> **Warning:** This property should ONLY bet set from the [OnStateChange()](../language_reference/onstatechange.md) method during State.SetDefaults or State.Configure

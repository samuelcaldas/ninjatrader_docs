NinjaScript allows you to develop custom strategies in rapid time by using over 100 built\-in system indicators, 3rd party indicators or [custom indicators](developing_indicators.md). NinjaScript strategies are compiled and run natively within the NinjaScript application providing the highest performance possible.


 


Please take the time to review this section including the [Strategy Development Process](the_strategy_development_process.md).


 


Prior to running strategies live, please be sure to review the sections about [Strategy Position vs. Account Position](strategy_position_vs_account_p.md) and [Syncing Account Positions](syncing_account_positions.md).


 


## Tutorial Descriptions


All internal NinjaScript indicators and sample strategies come with full source code and can be viewed within the NinjaScript [Editor](editor.md). Please review the tutorials within this section for detailed walk throughs of custom strategy development.

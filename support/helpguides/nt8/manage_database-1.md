Equities can be alternatively added by typing the symbol name into an open chart or Market Analyzer and pressing the "Enter" key on your keyboard.

## Editing or Removing Multiple Instruments at a Time


NinjaTrader supports editing or removing multiple instruments at once. In the Instruments window select multiple instruments by holding CTRL to toggle selection of instruments one at a time or SHIFT to toggle selection of all instruments between the first selected instrument and the next selected instrument.


 


When editing multiple instruments any property that is not the same between all selected instrument will display as blank, allowing you to override the setting for all selected instruments or leave if you do not want to change that specific property. If a property is the same between all selected instruments the selected property will show its common property setting. 


 




| Note: Although most database operations are instant, please be prepared for longer database saving times when editing larger selections of instruments. |

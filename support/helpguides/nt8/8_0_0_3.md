## Release Date


July 14, 2015


 


This release holds over 200 bug fixes, with major effort going into stabilizing the Playback connection which had several bugs reported that needed resolution. 


 


We added 2 new skins "Slate Dark" and "Slate Light" which are non\-gradient versions of the already existing light and dark skins. We also added the ability for charts to center on price with a fixed scale and improved text input to allow for multiple line input.

•AddPlot() – Pen signature removed. Use Stroke instead

•Stroke object – Pen constructor removed.

•Brush2String() – Renamed to BrushToString()

•Pen2String() \- Renamed to PenToString()

•String2Brush() \- Renamed to StringToBrush()

•String2Pen() \- Renamed to StringToPen()

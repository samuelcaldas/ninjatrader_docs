| Understanding the impact of installing Add\-Ons NinjaTrader provides a development environment allowing low\-level access to 3rd party developers to build integrated indicators, drawing tools, automated strategies and more. An Add\-On with software bugs can have adverse effects on the entire NinjaTrader application. These add\-ons also natively run on your computer, therefore, its important to only install 3rd Party Add\-Ons from sources you trust.    The following symptoms post installation could indicate an Add\-On is installed causing negative impact:    - Windows become slow or unresponsive to user interaction- Market data becomes unusually slow to load or update- Standard features fail to work as designed- Other scripts fail to work as designed (custom scripts that work on their own may conflict with each other)- Lost connections from market data providers- Error messages are generated at various times- The entire application shuts down abruptly and without warning  If you run into any of the above symptoms post installation of a 3rd Party Add\-Ons please try uninstalling the 3rd Party Add\-Ons to see if the problem goes away and contact the 3rd party developer for support. |

| Updating Add\-Ons Developers can issue updates to fix issues or add functionality. If you have obtained an updated copy of your 3rd Party Add\-On, you can import the new version using the same steps you originally used to install by going to Tools \> Import \> NinjaScript Add\-On... and selecting the new file.  During the import process, you will be given an option to replace the current Add\-Ons which exists on your PC, which you should accept for each file you wish to update.       | Note:  You should always restart NinjaTrader after installing an update to ensure you are running the most recent code. | | --- |      Removing 3rd Party Add\-Ons Should you identify a problem, or suspect a 3rd Party Add\-On is causing problems, you may wish to remove these files from your system.  The exact steps to remove will depend on how it was distributed. 3rd Party Add\-ons can be installed either as a "Protected Assembly" or "Non\-Protected".  Please see the information below on how to proceed.   Removing Protected 3rd Party Add\-Ons Assemblies If you have purchased a 3rd Party Add\-On, it is likely distributed as a Protected Assembly.  These protected files can be uninstalled by going to Tools \> Remove NinjaScript Assembly.  If you cannot find the 3rd Party Add\-On from this dialog, your Add\-On is most likely a non\-protected assembly.   Removing Non\-Protected 3rd Party Add\-Ons Most free 3rd Party Add Ons downloaded from online forums and other communities are distributed as unprotected c\# scripts.  These open\-source files can be uninstalled using the following steps:   1\.From the Control Center window select the menu New \> NinjsScript Editor to open the [NinjaScript Editor](editor.md)2\.On the right side, under the "NinjaScript Explorer" expand the type of folder of the 3rd Party Add\-On you are trying to uninstall3\.Locate the name of the 3rd Party Add\-On (Note: 3rd Party Add\-Ons can be installed in several sub\-folders)4\.Right click on entry \> select "Remove" |

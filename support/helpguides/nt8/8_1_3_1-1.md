April 10, 2024
 
| Features |
| --- |
| Order Flow \+ VWAP Drawing Tool Feature \#11637    r3vwap   The Order Flow \+ VWAP drawing tool enables the ability to plot a VWAP for the specified bars. This gives flexibility to easily see the VWAP during the desired range of bars. |
| T \& S Aggregation Feature \#11969    r3tsagg   The T \& S window can have many lines of updates come through very quickly, making it difficult to view. With aggregation you can simplify the display to provide updates by the selected time frame. All volume at the same price and location compared to the bid/ask value will be bundled together, time stamped with the initial tick. This can help identify large trades that may have been separated across multiple orders. |
| Chat with Virtual Assistant Feature \#13291   r3chat   With the new Chat, available within the Control Center, you will be able to quickly get many questions answered by the Virtual Assistant. If the Virtual Assistant is unable to resolve your inquiry, you can easily request support from a live representative. |
| Update from Platform Feature \#9225   r3update   With the added ability to update NinjaTrader within the platform you will be notified at start up of available updates and also within the Control Center. Selecting Install will download and install the available update right from the platform, preventing the need to manually download and install from the web. |
| Additional Account Risk Columns Feature \#13037   r3risk   The additional Account columns can be enabled under Properties by right clicking on the Accounts grid. The additional columns will give display updates based on Risk settings applied to your account. |
| News Feed Feature \#6864   r3news   A news feed is now available with the NinjaTrader connection. Being able to access and filter news within the application assists in getting the articles you are looking for quickly. |
| Bold/Italic Data Series Label When Selected Feature \#10565   r3bold   When multiple data series reside within one panel, at times it can be difficult to identify which plot is for which data series. Now, you can simply select the data series and the label will show in bold/italic to easily and quickly identify it. |
| Anchored Walk Forward Optimization Feature \#7031   r3optimization   With the addition of this Backtest Type you will have the ability to further fine tune your strategies. This functions similar to the Walk Forward Optimization. However, each step optimizes from the start date. |
| NinjaScript Editor Hot Keys for Outlining Feature \#12358   r3outlining   Additional outlining Hot Keys have been added to give expanded functionality and clarification of their actions. |
| Improved Logic to Help Prevent Reusing OCO IDs Featuer \#11973   Manually placing OCO orders now has smart logic for when a new OCO ID is needed. This will enable users to place OCO orders quicker and help prevent expired OCO IDs from being reused, which would result in rejected orders. OCO IDs will now be reset when two orders have been placed with the same OCO ID, an order an OCO is canceled or rejected, and when an order with an OCO is filled. |

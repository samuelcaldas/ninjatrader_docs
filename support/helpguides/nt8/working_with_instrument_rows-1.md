The Market Analyzer window allows you to display a variety of real\-time quotes, indicator values, and position information on multiple instruments. You can add, remove, and organize individual  instrument rows, [Instrument Lists](instrument_lists-1.md), Label rows, Blank rows, and a Total row with the instructions listed below.

| Adding an Instrument You can add an individual instrument to the Market Analyzer through one of the techniques below:   - Press down on your right mouse button in the Market Analyzer window and select the menu item Add Instrument(s).  Through the Instrument  Selector menu, you can navigate through various instrument lists to locate the instrument you desire, and left click on the instrument to add the individual instrument to the Market Analyzer.  MarketAnalyzer_8   - With the Market Analyzer window selected begin typing the instrument symbol directly on the keyboard. Typing will trigger the Overlay Instrument Selector.  MarketAnalyzer_2   - Double left mouse click in a Blank row under the Instrument column to get a flashing text cursor.  After the cursor is showing in the row you can type in the symbol of your choice and press enter to add the instrument.  Editing an Instrument Row To change an instrument, double click on an existing Instrument cell which will give you a flashing text cursor, allowing you to edit the instrument to a new instrument of your choice.   Adding an Instrument List You can rapidly add a list of instruments to the Market Analyzer window.   - Press down on your right mouse button in the Market Analyzer window and select Add Instrument(s) \> and then select the desired "Instrument List" and then Select All.  Please see the [Instrument Lists](instrument_lists-1.md) section of the user help guide for additional information on creating, editing, and deleting Instrument lists.    | Tip: It is more efficient to add instruments after [defining the columns](working_with_columns-1.md) of your Market Analyzer window. This will minimize NinjaTrader re\-loading historical data into the Market Analyzer window. | | --- | |

![tog_minus](tog_minus-1.gif)        [How to add Label rows](javascript:HMToggle('toggle','HowToAddLabelRows','HowToAddLabelRows_ICON'))
| Label rows are user defined and can be used to separate groups of instruments in any way (by asset class, instrument list, etc.).   Adding Label Rows in the Market Analyzer Window Press down on your right mouse button inside the Market Analyzer window and select the menu Add Label Row.  Once the Label row is added you can type in any user defined name.   MarketAnalyzer_3   Editing the Label Row Name If you have an existing Label row you wish to go back and change the text, double clicking on the exiting Label row text will give you a flashing cursor, allowing you to type in a new name for the Label row.   Dynamic Sorting within Label Rows Instruments you drag or add under a Label row will "auto\-sort" with only the other instruments under the same Label row. For example, if you have one Label row for futures and one for stocks, when you sort the columns, the instruments listed under the futures label would be sorted only against other instruments under the futures label, while instruments under the stocks label would be sorted only against instruments under the stocks label.  For more information on ranking and sorting within the Market Analyzer see the [Dynamic Ranking and Sorting](dynamic_ranking_and_sorting-1.md) section of the user help guide.   Aligning a Label Row The label of a Label Row can be aligned to the left, center or right of the row. This is done by right mouse clicking within the Market Analyzer and selecting the Properties menu. Change the property Label row text alignment to either "Left", "Center", or "Right". |

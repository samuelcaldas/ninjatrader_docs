| Attention 32-Bit Users:  - 64-bit has become the standard for applications in the Windows environment- As we continue to modernize our desktop platform and clearing up performance related confusions around 32 vs 64 bit NinjaTrader Desktop usage- NinjaTrader 8.0.27.0 will be solely a 64-bit Windows application, this means the installation directory will change from C:\\Program Files (x86) to C:\\Program Files- To initiate the update simply follow the [installer](https://ninjatrader.com/PlatformDirect) and restart the PC. |

8.0.27.0 Release Date
November 29, 2022
| Features |
| --- |
| SQLite Database technology Database Feature #15258   We have updated our core internal database technology from the deprecated Microsoft SQL CE to SQLite. Supported / documented NinjaScript code will not be impacted by this change; however if you have specifically developed your Add-On to call or interact with the Microsoft SQL CE database you should review and update code for compatibility. |
| Added ability to roll positions from Control Center position grid Orders, Position Display Feature #14350   r27rollposition   On the Positions tab of the Control Center you can now right click on Futures position and select Roll Position. This will send a Market order to exit the position in the current contract month and send another Market order in the next contract month to roll your position. |
| Historical Data window tabs unified and displays prior to connecting to Playback Historical Data Window, Playback Feature #15305   r27historicaldatawindow   The Historical Data Window has now been unified into a single tab for simplicity. Now you can view what data is already loaded while deciding what data to download. Additionally, the Historical Data Window will now appear before connecting to Playback. This will enable you to view what Market Replay data is loaded and download desired data before continuing. |
| Place Lines at 45 Degree Increments DrawingTool Feature #15263   r27lineangel   With the line drawing tools, after placing the first anchor, you can hold SHIFT on the keyboard and move the mouse around to adjust the line in 45 degree increments. This is based on chart scaling at the time the line is placed. |
| Added Save-As Option When Closing Default Workspace Workspaces Feature #15222   r27defaultworkspace   Now when modifying a default workspace, which cannot be save, you will be asked if you would like to save it as a different name |
| Added Property to Show Number of Trades on Strategies Tab Control Center, Strategy Feature #15351   r27numberoftrades   The Number of Trades column in the Strategies tab will display the number of Real-time & Historical trades that occurred with the enabled strategy. This column is disabled by default, but can be enabled by right clicking on the Strategies tab of the Control Center and selecting Properties. |
| All System NinjaScript types can be exported NinjaScript Editor Feature #14665   Previously only indicators from System NinjaScript could be exported. Now all System NinjaScript types can be exported to allow successful exports. For example an indicator that references a share service could now successfully be exported. |

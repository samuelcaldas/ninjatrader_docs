A common concept many traders use is the idea of a breakout. Points of interest are when the price breaks out from a consolidation range or from previous highs and lows.
 
## Key concepts in this example
- Determining and storing the first 30 bar high

- Submitting a long stop order to be filled when price breaks out from the 30 bar high

- Closing positions after a certain amount of bars have passed

- Resetting the 30 bar high at the start of every new trading session

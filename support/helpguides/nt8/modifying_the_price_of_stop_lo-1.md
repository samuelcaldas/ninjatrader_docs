One of the benefits of NinjaScript is the ability to automatically submit stop loss and profit target orders in real-time triggered when your entry order is filled.
 
## Key concepts in this example
- Submitting a stop loss and profit target order using default values offset from your entry order average fill price

- Modification of the stop loss order to a break even price once a desired level of profit has been reached
